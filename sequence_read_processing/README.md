Script were run following the numbered order. The first script [1.TSO_and_polyA_trimmer_sbatch.sh](https://github.com/giacomellolab/Brugia_malayi_study/blob/main/sequence_read_processing/1.TSO_and_polyA_trimmer_sbatch.sh) utilizes the TSO_polyA_trimming.sh script found [here](https://github.com/ludvigla/VisiumTrim
). Genomic sequence and annotation files for Brugia malayi were acquired from WormBase: WBPS14 and for Wolbachia were acquired as RefSeq: NC_006833.1. gffread from cufflinks (v2.2.1) was used to convert the Brugia malayi annotation file from GFF to GTF. 10X Genomics Space Ranger (v1.2.0) was used to build a combined Brugia malayi-Wolbachia reference in [2.spaceranger_mkref_commands.sh](https://github.com/giacomellolab/Brugia_malayi_study/blob/main/sequence_read_processing/2.spaceranger_mkref_commands.sh) and to generate gene expression matrices in [3.spaceranger_count_commandlines.sh](https://github.com/giacomellolab/Brugia_malayi_study/blob/main/sequence_read_processing/3.spaceranger_count_commandlines.sh)
